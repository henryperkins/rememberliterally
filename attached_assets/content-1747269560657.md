### Added

- Upgrade: Automatically convert arbitrary values to named values when possible (e.g. `h-[1lh]` to `h-lh`) ( [#17831](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17831), [#17854](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17854))
- Upgrade: Update dependencies in parallel for improved performance ( [#17898](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17898))
- Add detailed logging about `@source` directives, discovered files and scanned files when using `DEBUG=*` ( [#17906](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17906), [#17952](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17952))
- Add support for generating source maps in development ( [#17775](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17775))

### Fixed

- Ensure negative arbitrary `scale` values generate negative values ( [#17831](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17831))
- Fix HAML extraction with embedded Ruby ( [#17846](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17846))

- Fix incorrectly replacing `_` with ` ` in arbitrary modifier shorthand `bg-red-500/(--my_opacity)` ( [#17889](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17889))
- Don't scan `.log` files for classes by default ( [#17906](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17906))
- Ensure that custom utilities applying other custom utilities don't swallow nested `@apply` rules ( [#17925](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17925))
